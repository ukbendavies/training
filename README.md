# Training

My personal training and a place for me to gather together interesting articles along the way.

To view or use the examples: please sync this repo and open in a local client e.g. Chrome / Edge. You can view the html code on github however the html does not render inline.

I hope you find this research as interesting as I do and I hope it helps you out or you'd like to contribute it would be great to get your insights too. I have licensed the repo as MIT so please do what you like with my content thanks and give me a star if you find this useful.

## Topics include

- [Content Security Policy](./security/ContentSecurityPolicy/csp-sri-enforcement.html) - mitigating cross site scripting (XSS) attacks
