# Training

My personal training and a place for me to gather together interesting articles along the way.

To view any of the html examples, sync this repo and open the html in a local browser. If viewed on github the html does not render inline.

I hope you find this as interesting as I do and if this helps you out or you'd like to contribute that is great too, all licensed as MIT so do what you need with my content thanks.

## Topics include

- [Content Security Policy](./security/ContentSecurityPolicy/csp-sri-enforcement.html) - mitigating cross site scripting (XSS) attacks
