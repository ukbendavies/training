    <h1>Understanding Content Security Policy (CSP)</h1>

    <p>
        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CSP helps mitigate Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>
            <li>Should be used as part of a defense in depth strategy.</li>
            <li>In essence policies define an allow-list for authorizing use of client (browser) technology such as java script, css, fonts, ...</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    Making this page has helped me understand Content Security Policy by building a real world example that enables only required capabilities and mitigates possible XSS attack vectors by 
    disabling all non essential functionality. My requirements included: loading a same-origin css, a font family from the Google CDN and jquery from the Cloudflare CDN. Using the meta tag approach to define a CSP 
    policy for this single html page met the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Furthermore I wanted to demonstrate a real world use case by applying a very restrictive policy to protect the 'jquery library' resource that is downloaded from the 
    Cloudflare CDN by using Subresource Integrity (SRI) and a less restrictive policy to load the Roberto font family from Google. When viewed in the web browser, demonstrate 
    how CSP policy is applied and how the affects can be observed using standard in-browser developer tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Observing CSP policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Open Chrome -> Developer Tools (F12) -> Network view</li>
            <li>Refresh this page observing the Network view</li>
            <li>Verify CSP policy has been successfully applied.</li>
            <li>1st jquery script should load successfully: integrity hashes match</li>
            <li>2nd jquery script <b>must fail to load and can be observed as '(blocked:csp)' in the status column</b> because the 'BROKEN' integrity does not match that 
                required by the 'script-src' policy.</li>
            <li>Can you see 1, 2, 3 along the sections headers? This indicates the same origin CSS has been applied successfully!</li>
            <li>Fonts should have loaded and been applied from the CSS; this can be observed as type: font from teh network trace.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always define: default-src 'none' or 'self'. Failing to set this is the same as allowing access to all resources for any '*-src' directive.</li>
            <li>Single Quotes are evaluated as part of CSP Meta tag policies.</li>
            <li>Ideally CSP is applied via response headers as a site/application wide process. Note that some directives aren't supported using meta tags; e.g. sandbox. However 
                the meta tag approach is better than not using CSP and can be a helpful approach if headers cannot be set or you want specific policy for a particular page.</li>
            <li>Correct use of the 'integrity' attribute for script blocks is recommended regardless whether or not using CSP.</li>
            <li>'script-src' should include a valid integrity hash that matches the Script block integrity attribute, and must evaluate to the actual script hash rules, or it will get 
                blocked from loading. Fundamentally this is exactly the reason to implement SRI and CSP to prevent unknown/unintended modifications.</li>
            <li>Use of inline style or scripts should be avoided. Always load resources from external entities, this is generally a good practice.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
